Tried not returning from edf and using avg in case of not schedulable
	but then we visit so few solutions and like ok we get a more precise cost 
	but it does not make up for it i think. we visit more solutions the other way,
	usually end up at a good one. the disadvantage of this is the cost becomes kind 
	of artificial and maybe two solutions that are both infeasible but have very different 
	true costs(avg wcrt) are given the same cost. so the fear would be that we do not 
	visit many infeasible solutions and that infeasible solutions are treated the same.
	but they are not treated the same way anyway bc might be feasible for et schedulability 
	check but not for edf and vice versa. also why would an infeasible "solution" with some cost
	necessarily be closer to a good feasible solution (in terms of neighborhood) than some other 
	infeasible solution with a higher cost? it should be though because neighborhood is well behaved
	or whatever they call it. but still. otherwise we could anneal it would just be random search.
